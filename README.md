## Local development

After cloning the repo run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

The (Webpack) development server can be started with `npm run develop` after which it will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`. The server can also be started separately with `npm start` and running `webpack -w` separately.

### ESLint
We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) for linting JavaScript in order to keep the style uniform. ESLint has integrations for all major IDE's and we highly recommend installing it.
